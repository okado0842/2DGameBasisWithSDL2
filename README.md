# 2DGameBasisWithSDL2
I'm making 2D game basis for making a 2D action game. Just showing a few source codes for the some proof of how actually I do programming. These works are only done by myself so these codes might not follow the commonly format, but it doesn't mean I won't follow the specific format when I work as team development.
